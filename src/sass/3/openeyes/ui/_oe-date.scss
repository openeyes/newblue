// OE Date Layout
// to align the column layout of dd MMM YYYY
// Dates are wrapped with spans
.oe-date {
	white-space: nowrap; // dates must not wrap.
	
	// this is tricky. the problem here occurred in Meds
	// an icon is used to show start / stop dates.
	// if I align all the <td> the icons don't line up.
	// flex also didn't work. decided to go with a 
	// fixed width approach... 
	display:inline-flex;

	// this ensures data widths are consistent for:
	// for: dd Mth YYYY 
	// and: Mth YYY 
	// and: YYYY  		
	width: 11ch;
	
	.day {
		text-align: right;
		// because of being right aligned this needs to fit '00' as tightly as possible
		// this is so that single digits "1" lines up with "11" correctly
		width:2ch; 			// will need increasing to allow for font-size
		margin:0 1ch 0 0;		// this provides 'padding' between Mth (do NOT use padding tho ;)
	}
	.mth{
		text-align: left;		// if used in table in the last column it will be aligned to the right!
