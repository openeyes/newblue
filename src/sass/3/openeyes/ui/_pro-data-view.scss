// when first introduced this was called "listview-expand-collapse"
// now it's "oe-pro-data-view" (as this is more descriptive)
.pro-data-view {
	@include flex(flex-start, space-between);

	// wrapper for Pro / Standard DOMs
	.pro-standard-views {
		flex: 1 1 0;

	// this used to be "pro-view-btn" AND the .oe-i pointer-events was set to "none"
	// in hindsight a bad idea, approach updated to make the icon fill the space,
	// this allows the interaction on the icon to still work
	.pro-standard-btn {
		// make the icon expand to fill the area
		.oe-i {

			height: 100%;
			min-height: 19px;
			background-position-y: 0;
